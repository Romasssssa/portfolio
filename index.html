            <p>under "Assignments" will be the work I have done during this quadmester for ICS3U0, also known as computer science.To be honest I was very nervous and was worried that this course might be very hard, and I wont be able to do it
                but i've been working hard.So if you want to see my progress through out the quadmester, open assignment! </p>
